## How It Works

1. Enter financial data into the input fields.  
2. Click the **Calculate** button.  
3. The system computes:

   - **Gross Profit** = Revenue − COGS  
   - **Gross Margin %** = (Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100  
   - **Total Operating Expenses** = Sum of all expense inputs  
   - **Net Profit** = Gross Profit − Operating Expenses  
   - **Profit Margin %** = (Net Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100  
   - **Break-even Revenue** = Total Operating Expenses ÷ Gross Margin Ratio  

4. Results are displayed in a structured summary section.
